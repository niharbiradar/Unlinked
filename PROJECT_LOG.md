# Anti-LinkedIn MVP Project Log

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Anti-LinkedIn MVP
- **Description**: A professional networking platform alternative to LinkedIn
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 13 (App Router + TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, React Query, FastAPI, Motor (async MongoDB), Docker

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 13 with App Router for modern React development
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with dark/light mode support
- **State Management**: React Query for server state management
- **Folder Structure**: 
  - `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `styles/` - Global styles and Tailwind configuration

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async Python API
- **Database**: MongoDB with Motor async driver for scalability
- **CORS**: Properly configured for frontend communication
- **Folder Structure**:
  - `main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
  - `routers/` - API route modules
  - `models/` - Data models and schemas
  - `db/` - Database connection and utilities

### DevOps
- **Containerization**: Separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Production**: Optimized Docker configurations

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding ✅
- [x] Create project log
- [x] Set up frontend Next.js 13 with TypeScript
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS with dark/light mode
- [x] Install and configure React Query
- [x] Create basic layout component with theme toggle
- [x] Set up backend FastAPI with Motor
- [x] Configure CORS and health check endpoint
- [x] Create Dockerfiles for both services
- [x] Update README with setup instructions
- [x] Create Docker Compose for local development
- [x] Add comprehensive .gitignore files
- [x] Set up proper folder structure for both frontend and backend

### Phase 2: Core Features (Planned)
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Post creation and feed
- [ ] Connection/following system
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Notifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)
- [ ] Real-time messaging
- [ ] Content moderation
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend Decisions
1. **Next.js 13 App Router**: Chosen for modern React patterns and better performance
2. **TypeScript**: Essential for type safety in a complex application
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with consistent design system
4. **React Query**: Efficient server state management with caching

### Backend Decisions
1. **FastAPI**: High-performance async framework with automatic API documentation
2. **Motor**: Async MongoDB driver for non-blocking database operations
3. **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
4. **CORS**: Properly configured for secure frontend-backend communication

### Database Decisions
1. **MongoDB**: Flexible document-based storage for social networking data
2. **Motor**: Async driver for better performance with FastAPI
3. **Indexing Strategy**: Will be implemented for user queries and content search

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- CORS properly configured
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Authentication will be implemented with JWT tokens
- Rate limiting will be added for API endpoints

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend component testing with React Testing Library
- E2E testing with Playwright (planned)

## Performance Considerations
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Next.js image optimization
- MongoDB indexing strategy
- Docker multi-stage builds for production
- CDN integration for static assets (planned)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete project scaffolding
2. ✅ Set up development environment with Docker Compose
3. Test the complete setup with Docker Compose
4. Implement user authentication system
5. Create basic profile management features
6. Build post creation and feed functionality
